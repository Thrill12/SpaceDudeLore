[#Faction]

## Summary

A fake faction acting as a face for [The Foundation](The%20Foundation.md) to publicly influence the galaxy without publicizing their own name. It was formed around when [The Union](The%20Union.md) was created in order to keep a balance against it. 

## Description

It is led in secret by [Avery Meadows](../Influential%20Persons/Avery%20Meadows.md), who is also a part of [The Chief Council](../Influential%20Persons/The%20Chief%20Council.md). Their public leader is [Nick Valentine](../Influential%20Persons/Nick%20Valentine.md), who acts as a puppet whilst the [Council](../Influential%20Persons/The%20Chief%20Council.md) is his puppeteer.

Its views are identical to [The Foundation](The%20Foundation.md), which fully backs the republic and its endeavours in political adventures.
