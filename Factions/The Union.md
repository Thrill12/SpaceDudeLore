[#Faction]

## Summary

First founded after [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md) to try to keep the people under control. It has traditionally been led by previous, proven members of government and sometimes even leaders of other planets, but has recently turned to be led by leaders from [Cazion](../Planets/Cazion.md).

## Description

[The Union](The%20Union.md) is an extremely large organization, which has spread its tentacles all across the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md). It has reached and exploited every single planet known to man, and is now trying to research ways to do the same to [6AB9HJG](../Planets/6AB9HJG.md).

They believe that the human race, the pure human race, was always and always will be the only race that's allowed to stay alive. This is why they tried very hard to hide the [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) and then make it look like a hoax (and throw away [Jade Heath](../Influential%20Persons/Jade%20Heath.md)), and also explains why they chased after all the [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md) from the galaxy.

Their favourite thing to do seems to silence the people that oppose them. An example is them silencing the past people of [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md), from before [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md) in a time where people weren't as spread out through the galaxy as now. 

[New Earth Republic](New%20Earth%20Republic.md) has been trying to fight [The Union](The%20Union.md) since its creation after [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md), slowly gaining ground. People have slowly began to trust the [NER](New%20Earth%20Republic.md), and [The Union](The%20Union.md) can't silence them anymore: the fight is on.
