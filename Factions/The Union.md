[#Faction]

## Summary

First founded after [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md) to try to keep the people under control. It has traditionally been led by previous, proven members of government and sometimes even leaders of other planets, but has recently turned to be led by leaders from [Cazion](../Planets/Cazion.md).

## Description

[The Union](The%20Union.md) is an extremely large organization, which has spread its tentacles all across the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md). It has reached and exploited every single planet known to man, and is now trying to research ways to do the same to [6AB9HJG](../Planets/6AB9HJG.md).
