# Kaias

## Summary

The alien faction of the [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) species.

## History

Not much is known on how their hive mind works, but what we do know is that when they are going against larger predators, they team up and form a battalion against the threat.

## Society

Of what we have noticed of the spokes on their [planet](../Planets/6AB9HJG.md), the [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) form a sort of cult around one central spoke. The largest one on the planet, 12.3km in height, seems to attract high amounts of activity at night, where many [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) circle the spoke, and switch on their scales. We don't know of any reasons for this, however it is similar to religious activities on [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md) in the 21st century.

## Technology

Their technology revolves around biological reactions and tools, for example using their dreadlocks to create a shield and a cloaking mechanism. These tools would be insanely intricate for humans to build, even out of hard materials, but to the [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md), it is all biological. This has multiple advantages and disadvantages, however - they are very susceptible to physical ammo from a longer range, armour-piercing rounds can still penetrate their dreadlocks, but they can regenerate their whole armour.
