[#Faction]

## Summary

They are egotistical men for hire who only work for their own benefit, and won't be afraid to backstab anyone that wants to team up with them.

Based on [[Pirth]], they come from a background of exploited coal miners who were exiled from [[Earth]] to the rimworld planets because of their criminal backgrounds. As they had a whole planet to themselves, they built their own criminal underworld on the surfaces of [[Pirth]] and [[Perth]]
