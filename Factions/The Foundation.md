# The Foundation

## Summary

Created with the idea of eliminating [The Union](The%20Union.md) from the face of the galaxy and liberating the people, it's a shadow corporation funded by mainly illicit means.

Run by [The Chief Council](../Influential%20Persons/The%20Chief%20Council.md) at [The Foundation Headquarters](../Locations/The%20Foundation%20Headquarters.md), it is a clean operation with no acceptance for corruption. They have existed in secret for hundreds, maybe even thousands of years, however they have only come out of hiding because of the lurking threat that is [The Union](The%20Union.md).

## Description

[The Foundation](The%20Foundation.md) likes to run operations with single members, however each of these members is believed to be partially enhanced or [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md). They prefer running missions in less important worlds as to not cause even more chaos in the already unbalanced environments of the other planets.

Sometimes, they find missions worth executing in closer [Union](The%20Union.md) space, and will send in teams of operatives for these high risk missions.

They have managed to harness the power of the [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) scales for cloaking, and created special [Cloaking Vests](../Items/Armour/Cloaking%20Vest.md) to suit up their operatives as soon as they captured a [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md).

In order for [Foundation](The%20Foundation.md) operatives to keep their secrets secure, a monitor closely reads their vitals, and as soon as they are unable to fight back an explosive device fitted in the wearer's back and one at the back of their necks explode. This removes the risk of opposing factions gaining access to the technology, and renders stealing this technology almost impossible.

## [D.C.F.M](../Locations/Division%20of%20Classified%20Foundation%20Milestones.md)

[The Foundation](The%20Foundation.md) has known of the [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) for possibly hundreds of years, but they have kept it under wraps in order to avert panic and concentrate on dealing with [The Union](The%20Union.md).

## New Earth Republic

The New Earth Republic is the public name that [The Foundation](The%20Foundation.md) uses when it needs to do very public actions. Most people that are part of
