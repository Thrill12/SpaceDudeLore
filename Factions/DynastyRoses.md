[#Faction]

## Summary

This faction is a neutral bunch of people from all over the galaxy all obsessed with one thing: [Glow Cane](../Species/Flora/Glow%20Cane.md). They will go to any length in order to protect their [Glow Cane](../Species/Flora/Glow%20Cane.md) and to gain more. However, they will not engage in hostilities for any other reason, unless defensively.

They originated from the wooded planet [Demeter](../Planets/Demeter.md), on which [Glow Cane](../Species/Flora/Glow%20Cane.md) grows the most, and are still based on [Demeter](../Planets/Demeter.md) after hundreds of years of cultivating their beloved plant.

They are not allies with anyone, but neither are they enemies - a truly extraordinary sight to see nowadays when there are wars at every corner. People of this faction absolutely despise useless wars over territory or trivial resources like water.
