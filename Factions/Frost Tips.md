# Frost Tips

## Summary

They are egotistical men for hire who only work for their own benefit, and won't be afraid to backstab anyone that wants to team up with them.

## Description

Based on [Pirth](../Planets/Pirth.md), they come from a background of exploited coal miners who were exiled from [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md) to the rimworld planets because of their criminal backgrounds. As they had a whole planet to themselves, they built their own criminal underworld on the surfaces of [Pirth](../Planets/Pirth.md) and [Perth](../Planets/Perth.md), creating a myriad of hiding places for criminals across the galaxy.

On these planets, criminals are treated as royalty: the more crimes against humanity you commit, the higher their reputation is of you. Even though they are a relatively small faction compared to [The Union](The%20Union.md) and [The Foundation](The%20Foundation.md) and their insignificant funds compared to the other two, the sheer amount of bravery that these operatives can show is astounding to everyone.

[The Northern Mental Institute](../Locations/The%20Northern%20Mental%20Institute.md) is located in their territory, and thus [The Union](The%20Union.md) frequently contacts their supposed members to drop off any individuals with any amount of crazy in them. When the transporters return, they usually carry tales from the patients, like the [Nova Superweapon](../Legends/Nova%20Superweapon.md), but are quickly dismissed as passing signs of being in a mental institute.

There have been tales of men from [The Frost Tips](Frost%20Tips.md) taking down whole sectors and killing hundreds of [Union](The%20Union.md) operatives in days or sometimes even hours. It's incredible what potential these guys have.

Their activities have slowly decreased over the years, with the most recent [Frost Tip](Frost%20Tips.md) flagged criminal activity dated months ago - is this the end of a faction or are they preparing for something big?
