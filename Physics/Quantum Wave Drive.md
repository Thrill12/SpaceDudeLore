## Summary

Based on the principle of [Quantum Wave](Quantum%20Wave.md) technology, this high-tech drive uses [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md) to exploit [Quantum Wave](Quantum%20Wave.md) in order to transport large masses quickly across space.

First developed in [2315](../Notable%20Years/2315.md) by [Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) scientists in the [Astro-Academy](../Institutions/The%20Astro-Academy.md), it allows trade to happen almost instantaneously between planets of the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md).

In its wake, it leaves traces of [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md). Engineered this way in order to prevent criminals from using these drives and escaping to unknown locations, even though this is very easy to surpass.
