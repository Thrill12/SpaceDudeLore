## Summary

Based on the principle of [[Quantum Wave]] technology, this high-tech drive uses [[Aspite]] to exploit [[Quantum Wave]] in order to transport large masses quickly across space.

First developed in [[2315]] by [[The Union]] scientist in the [[The Astro-Academy]], it allows trade to happen almost instantaneously between planets of the [[Galaxy]].

In its wake, it leaves traces of [[Aspite]]. Engineered this way in order to prevent criminals from using these drives and escaping to unknown locations, even though this is very easy to surpass.
