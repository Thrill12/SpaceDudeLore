## Summary

First discovered in [2312](../Influential%20Years/2312.md) with [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md), the [Quantum Wave](Quantum%20Wave.md) phenomenon is an inherently frightening display of how [Humans](../Species/Humans.md) still have large gaps in their knowledge. This discovery was one of the greatest ones for mankind, as it has allowed unfathomable trade potential between planets, but also incredibly dangerous.

## Description

[Quantum Wave](Quantum%20Wave.md) revolves around quantum entanglement. The sub-atomic particles that make up any and every object under the sun are paired together with the [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md) in place of where we want the object to be transported to.
