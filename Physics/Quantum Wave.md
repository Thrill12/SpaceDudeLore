## Summary

First discovered in [[2312]] with [[The Dawn]], the [[Quantum Wave]] phenomenon is an inherently frightening display of how [[Humans]] still have large gaps in their knowledge. This discovery was one of the greatest ones for mankind, as it has allowed unfathomable trade potential between planets, but also incredibly dangerous.

## Description

[[Quantum Wave]] revolves around quantum entanglement. The sub-atomic particles that make up any and every object under the sun are paired together with the [[Aspite]] in place of where we want the object to be transported to.
