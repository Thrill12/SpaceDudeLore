# D.M. Core

## Summary

A theoretical way of harnessing [Dark Matter](../Materials/Dark%20Matter.md), however never put into practice. The experiments that were done on [Thiyotis](../Planets/Thiyotis.md) were unfortunately not successful, and resulted in a cataclysmic event ([Thiyotis Detonation](../Large%20Events/Thiyotis%20Detonation.md)) that ruined all current and future life on [Thiyotis](../Planets/Thiyotis.md) for millenia.

## Potential outputs

- For every 1g of [Dark Matter](../Materials/Dark%20Matter.md), the [D.M. Core](D.M.%20Core.md) could output around 89.9 TJ.
