## Biography

Not much is known about her, except that she is female, she is deadly, and that she escaped from [The Eastern Territory Penitentiary](../Locations/The%20Eastern%20Territory%20Penitentiary.md). Her signature M.O is leaving kiss marks on the face of the victim with their own blood. There were some rumours that she was once a part of [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md), however these claims are quickly shut down by [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) when mentioned by anyone.

Several reports have been made of a woman reminiscent of [Centurion](Centurion.md) entering [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) space, but we do not know more about her at this stage.
