## Biography

Imprisoned 50 years ago, he was one of the reasons [The Eastern Territory Penitentiary](../Locations/The%20Eastern%20Territory%20Penitentiary.md) was established. He is so dangerous that no current penitentiary had the security measures in place for holding a criminal like him.

In 2637, he assassinated the then-leader of [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) when he was only 17. An insane feat that not even paid hitmen could manage. [Barteus Cromley](Barteus%20Cromley.md) went into hiding immediately after, only being found a year later when he tried to assassinate the next leader of [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md), but failing due to an insane amount of bad luck - a rogue ship pilot with no license crashed into his ship with which he was escaping from the failed assassination attempt.
