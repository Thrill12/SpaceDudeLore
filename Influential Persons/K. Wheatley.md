# Kye Wheatley

*Voice actor notes* - Kye is the sort of character who doesn't care about what others think of him. Early childhood made him the outcast among his school, and even currently in his line of work, he gets stared at. This isolation is what makes him extremely good at his work - he can always keep focused on what's there in front of him, and has the most vivid imagination one can have from the years of loneliness he has beared through.

## Biography

Built his own bike at 9. Established his own noodle shop at 13, and finalized designs for [The Cloaking Vest](../Items/Armour/Cloaking%20Vest.md), [Krasmus](K.%20Wheatley.md) is no stranger to tinkering. He joined [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) willingly, with the promise that they will give him all the resources for his future projects, if he also creates things for them. [Avery Meadows](Avery%20Meadows.md) recruited [Kye](K.%20Wheatley.md) when she found him intercepting [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) transmissions.

He got away with that by explicitly showing them how to fix it, and since then he has been the lead technology and research officer in [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md).

Once he took on the role of lead tech officer in [The Chief Council](The%20Chief%20Council.md), he swore that he will no longer work on any highly-destructive weapons and only defensive items, like [The Cloaking Vest](../Items/Armour/Cloaking%20Vest.md).

Has a facial deformity from an acid accident (he doesn't believe it was an accident, but just another way for his father to try and get rid of his rebellious son). He is missing his right eyebrow, among with any kind of hair on the right side of his face, and his eye has been damaged enough to still be able to see but not move it.
