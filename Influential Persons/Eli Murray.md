They got recruited into [The Chief Council](The%20Chief%20Council.md) by [Avery Meadows](Avery%20Meadows.md), who acted as a sort of mother figure for them after they joined [The Chief Council](The%20Chief%20Council.md).

Ever since young, they were trained to detect social cues and lies in an immensely varied pool of people. Where they grew up on on [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md), you never knew who to trust and they needed to be certain of who to trust. Sometimes, they were even suspicious of their own parents.
