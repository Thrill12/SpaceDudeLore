# Dr. S. Debreto

*Voice actor notes* - An acutely brained individual who is very handy with his mind. He is reminiscent of the character Egon Stettman from the game Starcraft 2 in his mannerisms and how they speak, and shares Egon's interest in science. All Debreto wants is access to better and more research, however will work alongside others when he knows it will help.

## Biography

Dr. Selmes Debreto was the person who originally designed and thought out the [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md) species, and also the person that set them loose.

He also worked alongside [Dr. G. Wood](Dr.%20G.%20Wood.md) to create the [Quantum Wave Drive](../Items/Components/Quantum%20Wave%20Drive.md).

Figured out that [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) were using his supposedly illegal creation to farm [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md) for their insanely powerful but also hungry [Quantum Wave Drive](../Items/Components/Quantum%20Wave%20Drive.md).

He was always relatively smart from a young age, but never smart enough to stand out from the crowd of talented individuals at the [The Astro-Academy](../Locations/The%20Astro-Academy.md). At least, not until he discovered certain new substances that were not discovered before. These enhanced his brain in ways that researchers still don't know the full extent of, but cannot further analyze due to his missing body.

Last seen on a cruise-liner going to [Ares](../Planets/Ares.md), his body is yet still missing.
