## Biography

Having first joined [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) some twenty years ago, [Avery](Avery%20Meadows.md) has built an incredible track record of achievements. She has eradicated a number of different rumours saying that aliens were real throughout the galaxy, single-handedly stopped the apparition of another opposing faction that would have destroyed the galaxy, and put in place measures to stop [The Union's](../Factions/The%20Union.md) expansion.

Discovering [K. Wheatley](K.%20Wheatley.md) was by pure accident when she found him intercepting some [Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) transmissions. After some thought, she allowed him to join [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) under strict supervision, and relatively quickly rose above any suspicions and gained an incredibly high rank.

She discovered [Eli Murray](Eli%20Murray.md) on an undercover mission to [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md) to figure out why all of [The Foundation's](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) ammo shipments from the surface were being detected by [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md). [Eli Murray](Eli%20Murray.md) was found hiding in one of the ships, trying to escape [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md), and [Avery Meadows](Avery%20Meadows.md) saw something in her so recruited her.

After spending years on [Eli's](Eli%20Murray.md) training, she could finally let them be a larger part of [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md), controversially adding another leader onto the already existing [Avery Meadows](Avery%20Meadows.md) and [K. Wheatley](K.%20Wheatley.md).
