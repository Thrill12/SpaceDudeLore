## Biography

Doctorate at 9. Established his own university at 13, and finalized designs for [The Cloaking Vest](../Items/Armour/Cloaking%20Vest.md), [Krasmus](Dr.%20K.%20Wheatley.md) is no stranger to progression. He joined [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) willingly, with the promise that they will give him all the resources for his future projects, if he also creates things for them. [Avery Meadows](Avery%20Meadows.md) recruited [Krasmus](Dr.%20K.%20Wheatley.md) when she found him intercepting [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) transmissions

He got away with that by explicitly showing them how to fix it, and since then he has been the lead technology and research officer in [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md).

Once he took on a primary reign in [The Chief Council](The%20Chief%20Council.md), he swore that he will no longer work on any highly-destructive weapons and only defensive items, like [The Cloaking Vest](../Items/Armour/Cloaking%20Vest.md).
