## Biography

Dr. Gareth Garwood worked alongside [Dr S. Debreto](Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md) to create [Quantum Wave](../Physics/Quantum%20Wave.md) travel after [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md). He worked tirelessly for years after [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md) in order to create more efficient and sustainable travel.

He unexpectedly lost contact with his closest friend, [Dr S. Debreto](Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md) 3 days after [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md).

## Death

He lived a relatively quiet life after he found out that [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) was farming [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md) for [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md) as he did not want to end up supposedly assassinated by [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) agents like [Dr S. Debreto](Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md).

He was also struggling with a severe [Glow Cane](../Species/Flora/Glow%20Cane.md) addiction, which ended up taking his life when he thought that taking more [Glow Cane](../Species/Flora/Glow%20Cane.md) would speed up time.
