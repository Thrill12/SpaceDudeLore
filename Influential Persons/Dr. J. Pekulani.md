## Biography

Not much is known about this person, except that he worked on creating the [Polaroid Gun](../Items/Weapons/Energy/Polaroid%20Gun.md). He was never alive to witness the gun's coming of age as [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) started using it as a base piece of kit in their anti-terrorism squads.

Logs in [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) database do indicate that he was once a patient at [The Northern Mental Institute](../Locations/The%20Northern%20Mental%20Institute.md) due to murdering multiple people when he was sitting in line for the canteen at one of his research facilities. He said he should have the right to get in line faster than the other people currently in line, and when security refused he used his final [Polaroid Gun](../Items/Weapons/Energy/Polaroid%20Gun.md) prototype to kill the security team and 2 of the people in the queue. If it weren't for the extra security in the hall outside the canteen, there may have been a genocide at that research facility.
