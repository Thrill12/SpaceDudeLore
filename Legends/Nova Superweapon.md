## Summary

Some people have reported that some patients from [The Northern Mental Institute](../Locations/The%20Northern%20Mental%20Institute.md) are working on a potentially galaxy-threatening super-weapon, but no concrete evidence has been found.

This supposed super weapon could trigger another quantum event to the extent of [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md), or even larger some say. This is, of course, pure speculation, and you should take this with a huge grain of salt as it is coming from a mental institute after all.
