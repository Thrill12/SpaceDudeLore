# Plasteel Gauntlet

## Summary

A large pair of plasteel gauntlets around 200kg in mass, the wearer must also wear a [TL5 Suit](../../Armour/TL5%20Suit.md) to hold the gauntlets without doing any damage to their bones.

## Description

Similar to the [TL5 Suit](../../Armour/TL5%20Suit.md), it is a rough exoskeleton for the hand. The fingers are tied to metal control rods that restring your range of movement slightly, focusing on raw power and strength in front of you. Of course, anyone with these on isn't as agile anymore, and must focus on maintaining correct form at all times, with the consequences of not following form quite dire.

It is also commonly found in [The Eastern Territory Penitentiary](../../../Locations/The%20Eastern%20Territory%20Penitentiary.md), where prisoners would often bet on fights between them, and would resolve their conflicts with pairs of gauntlets with no suits for the brave ones. This often ends in the murder of at least one person, be it a spectator, a participant, or a guard.
