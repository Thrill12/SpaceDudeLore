## Summary

### AMMO-TYPE: |PHYSICAL|

It is a physically-based gun, consisting of a mass driver barrel that accelerates its projectiles at speeds of up to 500m/s. It uses liquid nitrogen to cool the barrel enough so that the magnetic projectile inside can be accelerated to ludicrous speeds, and reduce any friction between itself and the barrel.

Ammo is typically found in [The Union](../../../Factions/The%20Union.md) stations, who use this rifle as part of their standard weapon kit. It is highly penetrating, however it won't penetrate [The Foundation](../../../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) armours - higher penetrating power is needed. It is also ineffective against [Kaia](../../../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) scales, however it was only tested on a dying specimen which dissolved soon after shooting it, so analysing the damage was quite difficult.
