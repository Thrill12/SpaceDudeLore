## Summary

### AMMO-TYPE: |ENERGY|


A once impossible idea now turned into reality by [Dr. A Lanipekun](../../../Influential%20Persons/Dr.%20J.%20Lanipekun.md), it shoots a vortex pellet, which when exploded uses [Quantum Wave](../../../Physics/Quantum%20Wave.md) tech to transport all particles in an area to somewhere in space, leaving a large vacuum which sucks in all nearby objects for a few seconds, then severely damages them when they return to normal.
