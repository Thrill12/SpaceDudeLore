[#Item, #Armour]

## Summary

A large, plasteel exoskeleton that increases the wearer's physical capabilities. It is mostly used in mines around the galaxy as a way to increase the effectiveness of workers without giving them better or more food, better accommodation, etc.

## Description

It first originated as the idea of a miner around 400 years ago, from before [The Dawn](../../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md), and it is still being used to this day in [Union](../../Factions/The%20Union.md) manual labour mines. Often, you can see illegal brawling locales where the fighters wear these exoskeletons - the blood from the victims of the brawling has been stained on the floor of these locales for hundreds of years, and many of the worker's suits are stained with a dark red substance.
