## Summary

This extremely delicate fabric incorporates [Kaia](../../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) scales into its weave, and it can be commanded to transform into its reflective state when enough current is passed through it.

## Description

It was invented by [Dr. K. Wheatley](../../Influential%20Persons/Dr.%20K.%20Wheatley.md) as a necessity of defense after his joining of [The Foundation](../../Factions/The%20Foundation.md).

Effectively acting like an "invisibility cloak" for whoever wears it, it has proven an extreme advantage that only [The Foundation](../../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) have seemed to possess.

Underneath the vest, the wearer has to wear a layer of metal-weave fabric in order to allow the current to safely pass to the [Kaia](../../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) scales.

The vest needs an approximately 59.3 kV/s to operate, and on loss of power the reflective surfaces immediately stop and stiffen up, rendering the wearer completely still until they regain power again.
