# Chimera

## Summary

Small, agile fish that like to stay in groups of anywhere between 500 to 5000. They are predators in their ecosystems - they like to quickly overwhelm their prey by numbers, then eat them.

## Description

They have 2 pairs of tails, one pair at the back used for propulsion forwards, and the other pair on the sides, allowing them to increase or decrease their depth significantly quicker than other predators and prey on the planet.

They have never attacked mankind, however would definitely be capable to as they have been seen killing sharks introduced from other planets into their waters.

They nest around the arches on their home planet, and also like to mark their territories with the bones of their prey. Oftentimes they attack much larger prey in someone else's territory to boast their superiority and to take over control - they are actively partaking in human-like control for territory.

We don't know about their level of intelligence, as any time we try to capture them, the others manage to somehow save their brethren, but assuming by the territory wars and saving their people we can assume that they are likely much smarter than fish on other planets.
