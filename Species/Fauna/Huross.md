[#Species, #Fauna]

## Summary

First originated on the planet [Bograugantunatu](../../Planets/Bograugantunatu.md), they escaped and civilization across the galaxy was almost aware of their presence. However, hired contractors were paid immense sums of money to get rid of any proof of their existence to keep the people under control.

Due to thousands of contractors seeking them through the [Galaxy](../../Galaxy/Galaxy.md), they eventually became extinct, however some of their remnants persist in some places in the [Galaxy](../../Galaxy/Galaxy.md).

## Description

These humanoid species were first designed by [Dr S. Debreto](../../Influential%20Persons/Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md), and were let loose as an aftermath of [The Dawn](../../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md). [Dr S. Debreto](../../Influential%20Persons/Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md) was somehow affected by [The Dawn](../../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md) on a psychological level, something that was not noticed with anyone else in [The Union](../../Factions/The%20Union.md) space. This led to a chain of events that eventually released the [Huross](Huross.md) outside the lab, and they were quickly reproducing across the [Galaxy](../../Galaxy/Galaxy.md).

The plasma in their blood is modified in such a way that the main component is [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md), which makes their blood shine blue.

Due to the [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md) in their blood, it allows them to perform [Quantum Wave](../../Physics/Quantum%20Wave.md) jumps at will. This is the main reason that [The Union](../../Factions/The%20Union.md) wanted them dead - if they reproduced enough, they would have had enough strength to overrule [The Union](../../Factions/The%20Union.md).

Other than their strikingly blue blood, they are similar to people in regards of diet, intelligence, speech, etc. With a bit of practice, a [Huross](Huross.md) could theoretically hide in plain sight, however no [Huross](Huross.md) has ever been witnessed so this is merely just a theory.

## Remnants

In their short lifetime, several [Huross](Huross.md) left significant artifacts across the [Galaxy](../../Galaxy/Galaxy.md) which are yet to be found. There are conspiracy theories that [The Union](../../Factions/The%20Union.md) shuts down every now and then, which suggest that these blue artifacts contain strong powers only capable of being wielded by members of the [Huross](Huross.md) species.

Even though it is thought that they are extinct, word sometimes spread of people bleeding blue blood, however they are always considered false accusations. Anyone who reports incidents like this are treated like they have just committed treason, insulting [The Union](../../Factions/The%20Union.md)'s ability to handle situations.
