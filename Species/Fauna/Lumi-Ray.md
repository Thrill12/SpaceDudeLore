# Lumi-Ray

### Summary

A species of animal that survives off of consuming traces of [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md) from asteroids. It usually flocks in groups, however some veer away from their flocks for a reason yet to be investigated.

## Description

These lumi-rays are very close to the manta-rays on [Earth](../../Planets/Earth.md), however they can be found navigating through some asteroid fields in which there are traces of [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md), or in the wake of warp-drives. Due to this, it is possible for lumi-rays to gather around smaller stations in space - big enough so that they have enough food, but small enough so they don't get scared by a large influx of ships.

They are a relatively rare occurrence, with their numbers unknown in the galaxy. We have not been able to observe them for long periods of time, as capturing them is nearly impossible and would break many laws set by [The Union](../../Factions/The%20Union.md) against animal cruelty, although some say their meat tastes like [Mackal](Mackal.md).

They are of a blue skin colour, with moving, reflective scales used for protection against radiation but also to communicate with their peers as sound cannot travel in space. They usually take up the colour of their nearby peers, however they are able to emit different lights in order to communicate different things.

Lumi-Rays feed off of [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md), often from asteroids - this fuels their extremely small bodies to the point where they can survive weeks or even months without eating. Surprisingly, they don't need water to survive, as no-one has recorded seeing them drink water vapour from surface-geysers on different planets.

Unsurprisingly, these specimens only started to be noticed after [The Dawn](../../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md) when [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md)was first introduced into our galaxy, and they can use it to warp to different places in the galaxy to avoid large commotions or to feed. They rarely do however, only warping a few times a year to feed and a few times to avoid commotions. Otherwise, they seem to enjoy their time "swimming" through the vacuum of space, happily exchanging colours between each other.
