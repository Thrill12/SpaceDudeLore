# Mackal

## Summary

A small species of mammals, akin to dogs and cats, farmed for sustenance on [Pirth](../../Planets/Pirth.md). They are fast and have their homes in caves.

## Description

These small mammals have very thick fur that people use on [Pirth](../../Planets/Pirth.md) as a sign of luxury. They live almost their entire lives underground, only going above ground if their nesting grounds are discovered by predators.

They are often kept as pets by people on [Pirth](../../Planets/Pirth.md) as they are easily tamed with berries. They don't serve much purpose however, other than look cute and be eaten once they are big enough.

### Diet

They eat small berries and lichen found growing on the walls of the caves, and are often seen chewing and gnawing on equipment dropped by early explorers on [Pirth](../../Planets/Pirth.md).
