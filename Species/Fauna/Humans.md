## Summary

The first-born of the [Galaxy](../../Galaxy/Galaxy.md), and the most technologically advanced beings known, they have conquered almost every planet known. Alongside with their immense power however, comes a frightening catalogue of extinctions, all of which humanity boasts about. One of these fleeting species was actually created in a lab on [Bograugantunatu](../../Planets/Bograugantunatu.md), called [Huross](Huross.md).

## Description

Normally passive carbon-based creatures that have become intelligent enough to take over the entire galaxy, but stupid enough to leave planets to die from their lack of sustainability in their technologies.

Bipedal creatures, with small hairs around their body parts and varying amounts of pigmentation in their skin.
