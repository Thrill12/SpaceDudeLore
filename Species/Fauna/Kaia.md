[#Species]

## Summary

Ruthless in nature and incredibly tough and agile, these insect-like aliens are sure to frighten any commander that comes across them. Few downsides when it comes to physical prowess, however not as technologically advanced as the humans, which is why they haven't spread into the [Galaxy](../../Galaxy/Galaxy.md) as far.

## Description

These seemingly innocent insect-like creatures are normally smooth on the surface, with what looks like dreadlocks of meat hanging from their skin. However, when they feel threatened either by their own species or otherwise, the dreadlocks open up and form a protective barrier, whose surface looks like reflective scales.

These reflective surfaces are still unknown in how they work, but they do offer invisibility to some extent. The only way to see them when they are in their "combat stance" is via infra-red cameras.

Their nervous tissue is made up of a material similar to [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md), in the sense that it appears to be everywhere around us. Unlike [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md) however, only [Kaia](Kaia.md) nervous tissue is able to access it, thus creating a basically uncrackable way of instant communication.

### Diet

Their home planet of [6AB9HJG](../../Planets/6AB9HJG.md) has a flora consisting of mainly small, grass-like plants that can sometimes flower or grow seemingly random fruits, however nothing becomes tall enough to resemble a tree, or even a bush. They feed on these, and sometimes feed on smaller [Kaia](Kaia.md), however their primary nutritious intake is [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md). They have microscopic "gills" which allow them to suck in surrounding [Aspite](../../Materials/Aspite.md) and consume it with no wasted energy.

We do not yet know what the [Kaia](Kaia.md) are composed of on a molecular level, however we presume that it is not carbon. Whenever we manage to kill one, its body melts into an acidic substance that corrodes anything underneath it and quickly evaporates, even in a vacuum.
