## Summary

A yellow plant that grows along large trees. When burned, its fumes invoke a high in any creature that inhales it, and there are no physical long-term consequences other than the euphoric sensation people get.

## Description

Its stems are a bright green dotted with yellow vein-like lines underneath the surface. Its flowers are shaped like a common [Earth](../../Planets/Earth.md) rose, but yellow and slightly glowing. Scientists at the [Interplanetary Botanical Association](../../Locations/Interplanetary%20Botanical%20Association.md) have found that increasing the temperatures the plant is exposed to when still in seed form just before it germinates causes the fluid inside the flowers to glow brighter. The reasons for this are still unknown.

## Side-effects of inhaling its fumes:
- easy to handle high
- euphoric sensation for 3 to 7 hours
- slight acidic taste when first inhaled
- a feeling similar to [Earth](../../Planets/Earth.md) mint in the inhaler's mouth
- slightly decreased perception of time, allowing the inhaler to perceive time at a slower rate than others and react around 10-20 times quicker than a normal being.
