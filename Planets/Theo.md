[#Planet]

## Summary

Now extinct planet due to [The Thiyotis Detonation](../Large%20Events/Thiyotis%20Detonation.md), it used to host the interplanetary Olympics every year. Since its detonation, no official interplanetary sports competition has been held.

## Description

When [The Thiyotis Detonation](../Large%20Events/Thiyotis%20Detonation.md) occurred, the whole planet was engulfed, destroying it and everything on it in the process. Many great scientific minds have been lost on this planet, too many to name.

When it was still alive, [Theo](Theo.md) had a thriving ecosystem, consisting mainly of peaceful flora. There was a certain undocumented species of a grass-like species which grew incredibly quick, and seemingly didn't depend upon the sun for energy. When cut, it also regenerated extremely quickly, but researchers still don't know how this plant managed to do this. We likely won't ever know, as there aren't any more specimens alive.

Some speculate that [Interplanetary Botanical Association](../Locations/Interplanetary%20Botanical%20Association.md) may have hidden specimens behind closed doors, others suggest that [Dr S. Debreto's Laboratory](../Locations/Dr%20S.%20Debreto's%20Laboratory.md) has some samples stowed away from when he was experimenting with flora.
