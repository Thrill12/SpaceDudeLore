## Summary

Currently a relatively unpopulated planet with a very high secrecy level. It is home to [The Foundation Headquarters](../Locations/The%20Foundation%20Headquarters.md)[](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md), and has been since its establishment.

## Description

It's a relatively warm ocean planet with minimal landmasses, which is part of the reason that the population isn't as high as other terrestrial planets. However, its underwater features are what makes this planet stand out.

There are large arches formed out of seemingly the dead remains of other animals, offering food and shelter for many generations of alien underwater fauna and flora. Species like the [Chimera](../Species/Fauna/Chimera.md) thrive here, as they can feast on all the food on the arches.

Its pink clouds reminiscent of the popular kids show throughout the galaxy [The Blue Panther](../Pop%20Culture/The%20Blue%20Panther.md) are due to a massive amount of discoloration from the water's surface. The plankton on this planet have evolved to be pink instead of green, and there is so much that they sometimes evaporate along with the water vapour, rising to the clouds and forming the signature pink clouds.
