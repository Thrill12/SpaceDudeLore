## Summary

With mainly igneous rock on the surface and many volcanic eruptions per day, the surface of [Thiyotis](Thiyotis.md) welcomes visitors with a hellish landscape. Once you dig past the surface though, you are greeted by an environment similar to caves on [Earth](Earth.md)

## Description

Average temperatures on the surface can range anywhere from 15 degrees at the poles to 150 degrees near the Equator. This massive variation in temperature allows colonizers to stabilize themselves here both on the surface and underground.

The main settlements are underground however, to prevent ANY risk of damage from the extremely high heat. There are smaller colonies on the surface which mostly consist of refugees from the other corners of the galaxy.

It didn't always used to look like this however. Its [Earth](Earth.md)-like caves are there for a reason. Years ago, [Thiyotis](Thiyotis.md) used to look and feel exactly like [Earth](Earth.md) - green pastures, blue skies, rain, thunder.

When [Humans](../Species/Fauna/Humans.md) first started experimenting with [Dark Matter](../Materials/Dark%20Matter.md), they thought it was going to be the fix to all of their problems - famine, global warming, lack of energy - but it was neither of them. In fact, it was quite the opposite, as it caused [The Thiyotis Collapse](../Large%20Events/Thiyotis%20Detonation.md), which affected life in the whole [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md).
