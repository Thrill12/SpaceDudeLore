# Bograugantunatu

## Summary

Home to [Dr S. Debreto](../Influential%20Persons/Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md)'s laboratory and the home planet of the [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md), it was quickly sabotaged by a team of [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) and [Frost Tips](../Factions/Frost%20Tips.md) in order to destroy any evidence for the creation and existence of the alien species. It now serves as a popular tourist destination, with its macabre secrets hidden under the surface.

## Description

With a uniquely purple atmosphere, it boasts one of the most beautiful night skies in the galaxy. Due to its relatively thin atmosphere, light pollution doesn't affect it much, and thus it is extremely easy to spot constellations and stars from the surface.

Once held [Dr S. Debreto's Laboratory](../Locations/Dr%20S.%20Debreto's%20Laboratory.md), in which [The Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md) were created. Some speculate that it is still hidden under the rubble of [Bograugantunatu's](Bograugantunatu.md) cities, but that may as well be considered fairy tales.

Some people don't even believe that [The Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md) were real, and thus heavily dismiss it. This of course, plays in favour of [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md), which has tried to keep this a secret from the public for hundreds of years.
