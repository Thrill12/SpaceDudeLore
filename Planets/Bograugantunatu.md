[#Planet]

## Summary

Home to [Dr S. Debreto](../Influential%20Persons/Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md)'s laboratory and the home planet of the [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md), it was quickly sabotaged by a team of [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) and [Frosttips](../Factions/Frosttips.md) in order to destroy any evidence for the creation and existence of the alien species. It now serves as a popular tourist destination, with its macabre secrets hidden under the surface.
