[#Planet]

## Summary

Home to [[Dr S. Debreto]]'s laboratory and the home planet of the [[Huross]], it was quickly sabotaged by a team of [[The Union]] and [[Frosttips]] in order to destroy any evidence for the creation and existence of the alien species. It now serves as a popular tourist destination, with its macabre secrets hidden under the surface.
