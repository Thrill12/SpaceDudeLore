# Pirth

## Summary

An icy planet in the North of the galaxy, it orbits calmly with its sister planet [Perth](Perth.md). They form [The Frost Tips'](../Factions/Frost%20Tips.md) home, and have guarded their egotistical adventures for decades.

## Description

Not many venture out as far as [Perth](Perth.md) and [Pirth](Pirth.md), however those that do are greeted with the coldest climates in the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md). Temperatures here can almost drop to -150 degrees. This requires extremely sophisticated equipment, and only those accustomed to the cold and born on these two planets can even dream of being productive outside.

[Pirth](Pirth.md) is a unique planet because its cave systems are home to an indigenous species of fauna called [Mackals](../Species/Fauna/Mackal.md). These are very nutritious animals akin to dogs and cats on [Earth](Earth.md), and are abundantly farmed here.
