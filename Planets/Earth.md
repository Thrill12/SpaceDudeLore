[#Planet]

## Summary

Home of [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md), it has become a massively overcrowded planet. Was once the former capital of the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md), however it all took a dark turn when the [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md) occurred.

Close to Earth is its moon, [Cazion](Cazion.md). When [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md) occurred, the millions of obscenely rich people boarded their shuttles and launched for [Cazion](Cazion.md).

## Description

Whilst from the outer space the planet looks green, [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) have managed to surround [Earth](Earth.md) with holographic displays, enabling them to display propaganda and beautiful scenery from the outside. This allows to keep the outside population in check, whilst they deal with the ravaging famine on the surface.

The surface is littered with nuclear power plants, and almost every sea has now been used as a nuclear dumping site for radioactive waste. As one could image, this has lead to the billions who lived on this once beautiful planet to starve to death and rot together in overcrowded places.

The population dropped from 23 billion at [Earth's](Earth.md) finest days to a measly 5 million nowadays. It is almost not worth it for [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) to continue supporting this planet, and if it weren't for the thousands of nuclear plants on the planet they would have done that centuries ago.

No person is allowed to leave the planet unless they accept having a permanent, non-removable speech and activity tracker, which would kill the person if they did something to hint that life on the surface was as horrible as it is.

Anyone who comes from the outside is greeted with one location that has been kept as a safezone, in order to show to the rest of the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md) that [Earth](Earth.md) is doing just fine. That location is [The States](../Locations/The%20States.md).
