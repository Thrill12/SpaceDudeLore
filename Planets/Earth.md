## Summary

Home of [[The Union]], it has become a massively overcrowded planet. Was once the former capital of the [[Galaxy]], however it all took a dark turn when the [[The Dawn]] occurred.

Close to Earth is its moon, [[Cazion]]. When [[The Dawn]] occurred, the millions of obscenely rich people boarded their shuttles and launched for [[Cazion]].
