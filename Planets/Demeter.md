## Summary

Forested planet on which [Glow Cane](../Species/Flora/Glow%20Cane.md) originates from. Almost every square kilometer on this planet is covered in flora that is very similar to [Earth's](Earth.md).

## Description

From outer space, the planet looks like a dark green, with almost no clouds surprisingly. Underneath the surface of the planet resides a sort of inner planet by itself which works in tandem with the surface. 

The flora on the surface acts like solar panels, using photosynthesis to take in energy from nearby stars and to direct that to the larger biological planet core inside. This enables the planet to survive and to keep warm, even with no clouds and precipitation on the surface. 

Luckily for any inhabitants, this means that there will never be inclement weather on the surface - [Dynasty Roses](../Factions/Dynasty%20Roses.md) colonies have been constructed in myriads of places on the surface, using up wood from their sustainable wood farms.

Even though many colonies have emerged on the inner side of the planet, they have been overtaken by the core in a matter of months, suggesting in a way that the planet is alive and could be considered one large fauna-flora symbiote.
