# Perth

## Summary

Slightly colder than its sister [Pirth](Pirth.md), [Perth](Perth.md) sits idly as not much happens on its surface. It is the smaller one of the pair, both in physical size and population, and boasts the roughest terrain surface in the northern quadrant.

## Description

Its terrain has been early impossible to conquer even after hundreds of years of people living on [Pirth](Pirth.md). There are mountains seemingly everywhere, and its plate tectonics act in such a way that plates move at a rate of metres per year. This along with the rough terrain have made it nearly impossible to colonize, bar some colonies on the poles where it's slightly flatter.

It is also home to [The Northern Mental Institute](../Locations/The%20Northern%20Mental%20Institute.md), on which there are currently rumours that someone is developing plans for a super-weapon. This mental institute was built on stilts above a large body of water near thermal vents, to ensure that the ice underneath it melting and freezing would not affect the institute.
