# Volla E539

## Summary

Seemingly empty moon with extremely active plate tectonics. These create an earthquake approximately every 73 seconds.

## Description

Ever since [The Dawn](../Large%20Events/The%20Dawn.md), this seemingly empty moon has been claimed by [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) and used its insides to build large farming facilities for the [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md). These have no connection to the outside, and even the people managing it cannot leave. The [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md) collected from the [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md) is teleported outside the planet, so there is no need for an entrance into the facility, ensuring the safety and security of the farm.

[Volla's](Volla%20E539.md) thick crust ensures that no signals can escape or enter the farm, keeping everyone inside it hidden completely. Only some people high up in [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) and [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) know this facility exists, like [Dr. K. Wheatley](../Influential%20Persons/Dr.%20K.%20Wheatley.md).
