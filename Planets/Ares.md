[#Planet]

## Summary

A desert planet with its main population being the incarcerated people from [The Eastern Territory Penitentiary](../Locations/The%20Eastern%20Territory%20Penitentiary.md). Its landscape doesn't permit much building, however the [Penitentiary](../Locations/The%20Eastern%20Territory%20Penitentiary.md) was built 5km underground to avoid the extreme heat of the surface.

## Description

With an average surface temperature of 169 degrees, no native life can be found. It is an empty, desolate world seemingly out of reach of humanity. However, with recent developments in terraforming technology, we have been able to partially colonize [Ares](Ares.md) with a penitentiary.
