[#Planet]

## Summary

Near the edge of the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md), a remote planet sits idle. First discovered by astro-cartographer [Jade Heath](../Influential%20Persons/Jade%20Heath.md), it is home to the [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) species of aliens.

## Description

Having never landed there, we can only use the imagery we get from the occasional satellite that doesn't get detected by the [Kaias](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md).

Dotted around the surface of the planet are these large, spoke-like pillars which are made from a shiny material. These can sometimes extend to be kilometers high (highest one discovered was 12.3km). Overtime, [Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) satellites have calculated that they grow at hundreds of meters per day, but we do not yet know what happens if a spoke gets too large.

On these spokes appear to be small, hexagonal structures, however the clouded atmosphere hasn't allowed the satellites to gain any clearer pictures of the spokes.

No indication of where the [Kaias](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) live has led us to believe that they live underground, and only come out at night time.

Some theorize that the spokes could be used for launching vessels into space, others theorize that they could be massive accommodations for their species. Either way, we can't examine them further until humanity manages to touch down on the surface of the planet.
