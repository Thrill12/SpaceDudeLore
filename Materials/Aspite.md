[#Material]

## Summary

A substance used as fuel for the [Quantum Wave Drive](../Physics/Quantum%20Wave%20Drive.md) and contained in [Huross](../Species/Huross.md) blood and artifacts.

## Description

A seemingly invisible fluid around all of us that scientists of the classical modern era described as the "Aether", it fills every single space and vacuum in the universe. Seemingly able to affect the quantum properties of particles it comes into contact with, and the source of [Quantum Wave](../Physics/Quantum%20Wave.md) travel.

## Composition

It is formed by extremely small, sub-atomic particles never encountered before in nature and only hypothesized by scientists, called simply "dots". These dots appear to surround us anywhere we go, and both have infinite and no mass at the same time. These 2 properties, along with the fact that each dot has a "spouse", allows us to transport matter at FTL speeds.

In order to transport something, we first have to link the dots surrounding what we want to transport with the dots of another space. Both participating dots in the "marriage" process have to be touching each other in order to be linked, and to "teleport to their spouse", a large spike of radioactivity has to occur.

[The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) obtains [Aspite](Aspite.md) by secretly farming [Huross](../Species/Huross.md) in a facility on the seemingly empty moon [Volla E539](../Planets/Volla%20E539.md).
