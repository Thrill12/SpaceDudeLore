[#Material]

## Summary

A substance used as fuel for the [Quantum Wave Drive](../Items/Components/Quantum%20Wave%20Drive.md) and contained in [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md) blood and artifacts.

## Description

A seemingly invisible fluid around all of us that scientists of the classical modern era described as the "Aether", it fills every single space and vacuum in the universe. Seemingly able to affect the quantum properties of particles it comes into contact with, and the source of [Quantum Wave](../Physics/Quantum%20Wave.md) travel.

## Composition

It is formed by extremely small, sub-atomic particles never encountered before in nature and only hypothesized by scientists, called simply "dots". These dots appear to surround us anywhere we go, and both have infinite and no mass at the same time. These 2 properties, along with the fact that each dot has a "spouse", allows us to transport matter at FTL speeds.

In order to transport something, we first have to link the dots surrounding what we want to transport with the dots of another space. Both participating dots in the "marriage" process have to be touching each other in order to be linked, and to "teleport to their spouse", a large spike of radioactivity has to occur.

[The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) obtains [Aspite](Aspite.md) by secretly farming [Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md) in a facility on the seemingly empty moon [Volla E539](../Planets/Volla%20E539.md).

## Dense Aspite Exposure

To efficiently transport and store [Aspite](Aspite.md), we need to compress it to fit into canisters. When compressed to high pressures, it forms a liquid, with a viscosity similar to honey. However, unlike any other compressed gas turning into a liquid, it does not turn back into a gas when uncompressed.

If a person is exposed to this dense version of [Aspite](Aspite.md), you can expect:

* permanent hair loss
* blistering and flaking
* bleeding
* vitiligo
* cell death
* 3rd degree burns

Because of this, one must handle [Aspite](Aspite.md) with a full body suit, gloves, helmet. if inhaled, [Aspite](Aspite.md) will cause a euphoric high, but it is extremely dangerous as even the smallest dose (eg. 2g-3g) could kill.
