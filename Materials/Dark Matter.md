# Dark Matter

## Summary

Incredibly rich energy source per unit volume, it is the potential perfect power source, with zero emissions, and all of its energy being used leading none to be wasted as heat, sound or light. The [D.M. Core](../Physics/D.M.%20Core.md) was attempted to harness this potentially galaxy-changing material, but to no avail.

## Description

It is a black substance with both a matte and glossy surface at the same time. It the densest known substance in the galaxy, and only transported in AI ships where there is no gravity and no air.

When exposed to air, [Dark Matter](Dark%20Matter.md) tends to quickly expand for a split second then collapses on itself, creating a void and teleporting itself to another place due to effects of [Quantum Wave](../Physics/Quantum%20Wave.md).
