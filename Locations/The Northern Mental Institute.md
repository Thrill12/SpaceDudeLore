## Summary

First established in [2421](../Notable%20Years/2421.md) to host the [Galaxy's](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md) craziest people, it now accommodates around 15000 different patients. Some have more troubling pasts than others, but one thing is common between all of them: none of them possess any type of empathy, sympathy, or compassion for others.

## Description

Most of its patient intakes come from [Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) territory, but it is open for anyone in the galaxy.

Often, transporters often leave the [Institute](The%20Northern%20Mental%20Institute.md) with rumours of [The Nova Superweapon](../Legends/Nova%20Superweapon.md), but are quickly dismissed.
