[#Location]

## Summary

Located in a classified location on [Thov](../Planets/Thov.md), [The Foundation](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) hosts its headquarters here. It contains many research facilities, storage rooms and conference rooms, with one of the game's missions being in here to choose who you side with for the path to the end game.

## Description

Extremely deep in [Thov's](../Planets/Thov.md) lays this massive building. Its style reminds some of the Gothic writing style from [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md), with massive arches around doors and medieval like construction, however with modern materials like plasteel and infinitely accurate building practices.

The building is composed of many sub buildings, creating a kind of upside down sky scraper going towards the core of [Thov](../Planets/Thov.md). Each level is separated by around 15m of rock, creating a seal in case anything in lower levels wants to escape, whether this be another science experiment or people with sensitive data.

The deepest level of the headquarters go down to around 5km, although there are rumours of levels even deeper than that hidden from the public eye.
