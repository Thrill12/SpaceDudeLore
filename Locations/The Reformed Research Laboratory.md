## Summary

Once the greatest known vault of knowledge in the galaxy, it created many of the technologies people use today. Even the first interplanetary efficient shuttles were constructed in the space-yards of this facility. 

## Description

[Thiyotis](../Planets/Thiyotis.md) remained a close ally to [The Reformed Research Laboratory](The%20Reformed%20Research%20Laboratory.md) for decades, and depended heavily upon the planet for its resources. In exchange, [The Reformed Research Laboratory](The%20Reformed%20Research%20Laboratory.md) would give back highly exclusive technologies to [Thiyotis](../Planets/Thiyotis.md) before anyone else.
