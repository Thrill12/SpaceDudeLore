[#Location]

## Summary

A highly classified station that almost no-one in the galaxy knows exists. Anyone who has worked on this behemoth of a creation has been either executed, or killed in "accidents" in order to keep it a secret.

It is located in the shadow of [Thov](../Planets/Thov.md), rendering it invisible to other planets and factions.

## Description

It holds [The Foundation's](../Factions/The%20Foundation.md) most valuable secrets, like [The Cloaking Vest](../Items/Armour/Cloaking%20Vest.md).

Unlike any construction before it, it has been built out of purely biological materials akin to the [Kaia's](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) nervous tissue. This allows it to communicate with any other [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) nervous tissue in the galaxy, and transmit data on the most encrypted channel ever created by mankind.

It is the size of a planet, and its energy comes from the [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md) around it. This living and breathing monolith has stayed hidden thus far, but for how long will that remain true?
