# The States

## Summary

A large, fake area on the surface of [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md) that has been the public focus on [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md) for centuries, it is the only uncorrupted location on that toxic planet.

## Description

The outside world does not know much about [The States](The%20States.md), except that it is a living museum about the past, and a "paradise" for the people that live there.

With an area of 9.8 million km squared, it boasts incredible views, incredibly clean water and a large, highly doctored population of actors who play the roles of ordinary people in this fabled paradise.

It acts as the only place that outsiders can visit - The excuse that [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) gives when people ask why they can't visit other places is that "they are all in renovation in getting them up to today's technological standards, and will inform the public when more information is known about when all the projects will be finished."
