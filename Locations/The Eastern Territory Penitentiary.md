## Summary

The largest penitentiary in the galaxy situated next to [Ares](../Planets/Ares.md), it holds an astoundingly large number of prisoners: 58,683. Thousands of prisoners are transported to and from other penitentiaries around the galaxy each day, intimidating anyone who would dare to set foot on this planet.

## Description

There have been countless videos of prisoners trying to escape the penitentiary to the surface, only to find them laying on the floor minutes later, dead from the heat and dehydration. Whilst there is oxygen, the pure amount of heat on the surface makes any living creature die within minutes without the necessary equipment.

It is formed of around 59 levels, each one hosting a thousand prisoners. As the penitentiary is growing each day, new levels have to be built - there are 2 new built per year. Each floor has:

* 50 canteens spread out across the entire level
* 250 rooms, in which there are 4 prisoners per room
* 100 toilets, of which only around 13 actually work consistently, creating large queues for the toilets as they don't have them in their rooms
* one large park in each level, which is roughly the size of a typical park on [Earth](../Planets/Earth.md)*

Originally built in 2653, [The Eastern Territory Penitentiary](The%20Eastern%20Territory%20Penitentiary.md) has an incredibly large black market, that the guards don't seem to do much about. People have been found smuggling weapons, grenades, exotic foods, even vehicles to use in the prison's extremely large parks.

The lower levels in the prison hold less and less prisoners, as they are considered high-risk prisoners. Down there, not even guards dare enter without full body armour provided by [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md). On the last level, there are only 2 people, both of which have not seen the sun for more than 50 years. One of these people is [[../Influential Persons/Barteus Cromley]]
