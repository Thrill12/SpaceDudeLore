# Fantasia - Nightclub

The sin acts as a base of operations for the [Player](../Influential%20Persons/Player.md), at least in the beginning or if they are not allied with any faction already. The nightclub is a largely violent place, and the [Player](../Influential%20Persons/Player.md) resides in one of the quiet, unrenovated spots in the nightclub where no-one comes in. The [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) is treated like family when they enter the club, as they have been living there ever since they escaped the prison. 

It is in [Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) space, so you are likely to encounter [Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) troops wandering around the area.
