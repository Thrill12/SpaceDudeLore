## Summary

Situated on the surface on [Bograugantunatu](../Planets/Bograugantunatu.md), it was once a highly prestigious place in which scholars from around the galaxy would come and discuss the latest scientific breakthroughs. It was destroyed when [The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) found [Dr S. Debreto's](../Influential%20Persons/Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md) experiments with [The Huross](../Species/Fauna/Huross.md). It has not been found ever since.

## Description

It once hosted the largest scientific yearly gatherings in the galaxy, with halls spanning hundreds of feet, all full of displays of marvelous science from various inventors. People like [Dr. J. Lanipekun](../Influential%20Persons/Dr.%20J.%20Lanipekun.md) visited this place to gasp at how much science there was being done around the galaxy.

Nowadays, it is merely an afterthought of people when they think of science. A faint memory for some, a legend for others. What everyone knows as fact though, is that without [Dr S. Debreto](../Influential%20Persons/Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md), there would be no [Quantum Wave Drive](../Items/Components/Quantum%20Wave%20Drive.md) and thus everyone thanks him in their mind.

## Previous experiments

[Dr S. Debreto](../Influential%20Persons/Dr%20S.%20Debreto.md) liked to experiment most days he was in his lab. Some of his assistants seem to recall times when he was playing around with the idea of a universal substance, something that was later found to actually be real ([Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md)). 

Other older assistants recall the times he used to experiment with different flora around the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md). He is even thought to have created a sub-species of [Glow Cane](../Species/Flora/Glow%20Cane.md) which are much more potent.
