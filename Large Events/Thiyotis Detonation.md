[#LargeEvent]

## Summary

On the 2nd of January, [2312](../Notable%20Years/2312.md), scientists experimented with [D.M. Cores](../Physics/D.M.%20Core.md) on the surface of the planet, in one of [Humanity's](../Species/Fauna/Humans.md) largest research facilities: [The Reformed Research Laboratory](../Locations/The%20Reformed%20Research%20Laboratory.md).

## Description

This massive explosion was detonated from all of [Thiyotis's](../Planets/Thiyotis.md) [D.M. Cores](../Physics/D.M.%20Core.md) seemingly at once. With no precedent to this event, no scientists had any clue as to what was going on on [Thiyotis](../Planets/Thiyotis.md).

The detonation brought hell upon the planet, triggering an extinction event like no other. It killed billions on the planet, and also on the planets around it. It even also completely destroyed [Thiyotis](../Planets/Thiyotis.md) sister planet, [Theo](../Planets/Theo.md).
