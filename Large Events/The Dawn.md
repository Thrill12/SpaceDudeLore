## Summary

On the 2nd of January [2312](obsidian://open?vault=SpaceDudeLore&file=Influential%20Years%2F2312), a large [[Quantum Wave]] unleashed from an unknown point in the galaxy, quickly accelerating the whole [[Galaxy]] to light speed for a split-second, transporting it outside the known universe to a seemingly empty void.

This triggered the founding of [[The Astro-Academy]] and the seemingly instantaneous discovery of [[Aspite]] throughout the [[Galaxy]].
