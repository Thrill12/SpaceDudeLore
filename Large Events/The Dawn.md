## Summary

On the 2nd of January [2312](../Influential%20Years/2312.md) a large [Quantum Wave](../Physics/Quantum%20Wave.md) unleashed from an unknown point in the galaxy, quickly accelerating the whole [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md) to light speed for a split-second, transporting it outside the known universe to a seemingly empty void.

This triggered the founding of [The Astro-Academy](../Institutions/The%20Astro-Academy.md) and the seemingly instantaneous discovery of [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md) throughout the [Galaxy](../Galaxy/Galaxy.md).
