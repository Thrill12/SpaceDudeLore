[Frost Tips](../Factions/Frost%20Tips.md) could team up with the [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md), it would fit both their savage natures.
[The Union](../Factions/The%20Union.md) trying to create a weapon of mass destruction using [Aspite](../Materials/Aspite.md), and the [Magnum Opus](../Items/Weapons/Energy/Magnum%20Opus.md) could be a very small prototype you gain later on in the game when you first reach a lab and are beginning to uncover what is going on. [Nova Superweapon](../Legends/Nova%20Superweapon.md) is what they are trying to build.
Player uses [Kaia](../Species/Fauna/Kaia.md) technology to get some of their memories back, which then leads them on a further quest to find out what happened, and they seek out the memoires of scientists who created the mind control science to try and reverse engineer them

Player progress through the game by finding certain leads throughout the game - maybe make it randomized kind of so the players don't all have the same path to victory.
First lead should always come from Payne Jones so that the player has an idea that they need to search for information more so than just weapon upgrades
